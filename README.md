# Leukemia-detection

The main task is to classify blood smears by looking at sample pictures of them. This is mainly a computer vision task. The main target is to design a new network to get results better than current state-of-art techniques.
Currently Experiments with VGG,ResNet,Inception have been conducted and it has been noticed that the accuracy on Inception Network is 100%.
Morever, Plans on Vector Concatenation of ResNet and VGG are being made to make a less complex and efficient network as compared to Inception
